**Requirements:**
1. output folder with csv files with measured intensities in the assigned ROI from "FDAP_batch_image_processing.ijm".
1. OR txt files with measured intensities in the photoactivation ROI from NIS Elements Software (Nikon) software.


* Plot data without extrapolation and fitting
* Plot biphasic exponential fits (also with data points - measured intensities in the ROI).
* Output the fitting parameters and the parameters for the goodness of fit.
